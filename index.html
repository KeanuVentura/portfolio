    <p>Aloha! My name is Keanu Ventura, and I am from Kailua, Hawai'i. I'm a Junior at the University of California San Diego, 
        majoring in data science and minoring in cognitive science. My high school AP Comp Sci teacher was the first to introduce 
        me to programming, and I immediately fell in love with the problem-solving and creativity behind it. Since then, Iâ€™ve 
        especially enjoyed using data to explore and analyze sports through various projects. I also am currently teaching and 
        mentoring students with the hope of sparking the same passion for data science that my high school teacher sparked in me!
