            <h3>StatPilot - NBA Player Prop Predictor - Winner: Innovation Launchpad Award</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Built an interactive web-based tool during a 2-day hackathon hosted by the UCSD Data Science Student Society that
                    predicted NBA player prop outcomes (points, rebounds, assists) using historical game data scraped from ESPN
                <li>Designed a predictive model in Python with SciPy, linear regression, feature engineering, dynamic weighting, and
                    cumulaIve distribution functions to calculate over/under probabilities</li>
                <li>Created a responsive web UI with HTML and CSS; pitched the project to a panel of judges</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Cooking Up Insights - Recipe Ratings & Calorie Prediction Analysis </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Built a Python-based web project analyzing 800K+ Food.com recipes to uncover trends between cooking time and
                    user ratings using data visualizations and hypothesis testing
                <li>Cleaned, merged, and filtered 800K+ recipe records; engineered and normalized features with StandardScaler and
                    QuantileTransformer; developed and tuned a Random Forest Regressor with 5-fold cross-validation to predict calorie
